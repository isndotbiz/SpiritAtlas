## Research Summary

### Energy Visualization Techniques (2025)

Based on current Kirlian photography and aura visualization research:

**Key Principles:**
- Corona discharge patterns creating flowing, organic energy fields
- Dynamic, stochastic (non-uniform) electric ionization effects
- Bio-energetic field visualization using GDV (Gas Discharge Visualization)
- Fluid, particle-based energy flow patterns
- Multi-layered aura fields with color gradients

**Aura Color System:**
- Red (Root): Physical security, grounding, material needs
- Orange (Sacral): Emotional, creative, social energy
- Yellow (Solar Plexus): Personal power, transformation
- Green (Heart): Love, compassion, healing
- Blue (Throat): Truth, communication, expression
- Indigo (Third Eye): Intuition, inner vision
- Violet (Crown): Divine connection, highest consciousness

**Energy Flow Characteristics:**
- Energy passes through chakras → auric field → external world
- Dynamic, constantly shifting based on emotional/spiritual state
- Flowing, wave-like patterns with particle effects
- Electromagnetic field visualization with depth and motion

## Original Images Analysis

### 1. 027_compatibility_analysis_-_energy_field.png
**Current:** Good flowing waves but could be more organic and dynamic
**Issues:**
- Somewhat symmetrical and predictable
- Lacks depth variation
- Could use more particle effects
- Energy feels a bit static

### 2. 059_torus_energy_field.png
**Current:** Nice geometric structure but lacks organic flow
**Issues:**
- Too geometric and rigid
- Missing fluid, natural energy movement
- Needs more corona discharge effects
- Could use depth and layering

### 3. 111_chakra_energy_flow.png
**Current:** Beautiful but too structured/rigid
**Issues:**
- Very structured, less flowing
- Energy feels contained rather than flowing
- Needs more dynamic circulation patterns
- Could show energy exchange more fluidly
