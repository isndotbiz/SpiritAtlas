- Style references (Kirlian, cinematic, photorealistic)
- Emotional outcomes specified

**Example Enhancement:**
```
BEFORE: "Two souls connecting with purple and gold energy"

AFTER: "Breathtaking vertical illustration of two luminous souls
connecting in cosmic space... magnificent vesica piscis formation
glows where their aura fields overlap... delicate golden threads
connect their heart chakras... sense of profound recognition and
soul-level love..."
```
