FILE NAMING:
- Scripts: lowercase_with_underscores.sh
- Make executable: chmod +x script.sh
- Include shebang: #!/bin/bash or #!/usr/bin/env python3
- Docs: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.md

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- All scripts must have usage documentation
- All scripts must handle errors gracefully
- All Python scripts must use type hints
- Include clear comments explaining logic

YOUR TIMELINE:
- Expected work time: 4-6 hours
- Claude Code agents: 6 hours
- You should finish around same time

CURRENT PROJECT STATE:
- Location: /Users/jonathanmallinger/Workspace/SpiritAtlas
- Current health score: 77/100
- Target: 95/100
- Build status: Passing
- Test status: 113 tests passing in core modules

READ FIRST:
1. /AGENT_SWARM_MASTER_PLAN.md - Overall mission plan
2. /CODEX_MAX_PARALLEL_WORK.md - Your detailed instructions
3. /FINAL_HEALTH_SCORE_REPORT.md - Current state assessment

COMMUNICATION:
- Create /tools/STATUS.md with your progress
- Update every hour
- Use clear commit messages: feat(tools): Add health checker script

START WITH:
1. Create /tools/STATUS.md (document your plan)
2. Create developer onboarding docs
3. Create testing automation infrastructure
4. Create build automation
5. Work through remaining tasks by priority

REMEMBER: You are building the INFRASTRUCTURE and TOOLING that supports the app. Claude Code agents are building the APP itself. Work in parallel, never conflict.

LET'S BUILD THE MOST ADVANCED SPIRITUAL APP INFRASTRUCTURE! 🚀
