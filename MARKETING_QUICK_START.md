## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it really free?**
A: Yes! Core features including profiles, birth charts, numerology, and basic compatibility are completely free. Premium AI-powered insights are optional.

**Q: How is privacy maintained?**
A: All calculations happen on your device offline. We offer local AI (Ollama) that generates insights entirely on your device. Optional cloud AI requires explicit consent. We never sell data.

**Q: Why 5 systems instead of just astrology?**
A: Each spiritual system reveals different aspects of your being. Numerology shows your life path through numbers. Astrology reveals cosmic influences. Ayurveda aligns your physical constitution. Human Design maps your energy. Tantric guides sacred relationships. Together, they create your complete spiritual blueprint.

**Q: What makes the images special?**
A: We created 119 custom spiritual images using FLUX 1.1 Pro AI, including sacred geometry (Flower of Life, Sri Yantra), all 12 zodiac constellations, 7 chakra visualizations, and moon phases. Average quality score: 9.2/10 - market-leading visual design.

**Q: Can I use it offline?**
A: Yes! All core calculations work completely offline. Internet is only needed for optional cloud AI features.

**Q: How accurate are the calculations?**
A: Extremely accurate. We use NASA-grade astronomical data for astrology, traditional formulas for numerology, and authentic Ayurvedic principles. 113/113 tests passing ensures calculation accuracy.
