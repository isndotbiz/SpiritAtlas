# Codex Max - Explicit File Permissions

## ✅ YOU HAVE FULL ACCESS TO ALL FILES

As of Phase 2, you are explicitly granted permission to modify **ANY** file in the codebase.

### Files You CAN Modify:

```
✅ core/ui/**/*.kt                  (All UI components)
✅ core/numerology/**/*.kt          (Numerology calculations)
✅ core/astro/**/*.kt               (Astrology calculations)
✅ core/ayurveda/**/*.kt            (Ayurveda calculations)
✅ core/humandesign/**/*.kt         (Human Design calculations)
✅ feature/**/*.kt                  (All feature screens/logic)
✅ data/**/*.kt                     (Repositories, network, database)
✅ domain/**/*.kt                   (Domain models and usecases)
✅ app/**/*.kt                      (App-level code)
✅ **/build.gradle.kts              (Build configuration)
✅ **/AndroidManifest.xml           (App manifest)
✅ app/src/main/res/**              (Resources)
```

### Files You CAN'T Modify (Don't Exist Yet):

None. Full access granted.

### Your Constraints:

1. **Only modify files for your assigned optimization tasks** (Agents 0-10)
2. **Don't create unrelated features** - stick to review/optimization scope
3. **Fix bugs and improve quality** - you're encouraged to do this
4. **Refactor code** - if it improves structure/performance
5. **Delete dead code** - remove unused imports, dead code paths
6. **Optimize everything** - that's your job

### If You Need to Modify a File:

Just go ahead and do it. You don't need permission - you already have it.

If you encounter a file you think you shouldn't touch, ask first. But in general:

**DO IT IF:**
- It's part of agents 0-10 tasks
- It improves code quality/security/performance
- It fixes bugs
- It refactors for maintainability

**DON'T DO IT IF:**
- It's unrelated to your assigned work
- It adds new features outside the scope
- It changes architecture without good reason

## Summary

You are trusted with full access to the codebase. Optimize aggressively within your assigned scope.

See `CODEX_MAX_COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW.md` for your mission.
